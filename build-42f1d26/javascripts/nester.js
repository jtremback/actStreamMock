To maximize their speed, the Courageous-class battlecruisers were the first capital ships of the Royal Navy to use geared steam turbines and small-tube boilers. ",

Just about every CIO in the world said the iPhone would never be allowed in the enterprise, right up until their CEO demanded it. Then the same CIOs discovered they could sell using Google Mail in their enterprise as 'Oh, it's just the same as GMail', while cutting their costs hugely over Exchange.
