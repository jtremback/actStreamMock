Just about every CIO in the world said the iPhone would never be allowed in the enterprise, right up until their CEO demanded it. Then the same CIOs discovered they could sell using Google Mail in their enterprise as 'Oh, it's just the same as GMail', while cutting their costs hugely over Exchange. Then VMWare came along and allowed CTOs to run non-homogenous platforms in the datacenter, and do it much cheaper than the old way.
